# TalentPlusStaff
Two projects are contained in the microservices, one is TalentPlusAttendance and the second one is TalentPlusStaff.
Build the solution and launch both the Web API services (Microservices) simultaneously. 
For this, we have to set both the projects as starting projects. For that, open the properties window of Solution
and then select multiple startup projects radio button and set the action to start for both the projects.
Click on the Start button and then we get two browsers opened and point to the controllers from browsers.
To call the Api, the url for the first one is: https://localhost:44357/Api/TalentPlusAttendance
The url to the second one is: https://localhost:44357/Api/TalentPlusStaff
